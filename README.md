# Peer Evaluation Automation and Feedback System

Date: 09/04/2025  
Status: Planning / In Progress

A web-based platform to streamline peer evaluations in team-based courses. Professors can securely create and manage student rosters, assign students to courses/teams, trigger email invitations, and receive structured, professor-friendly reports with both numeric and textual feedback. Optional AI features may summarize comments and flag potential concerns, depending on timeline and scope.

- Student roster upload and team assignment
- Personalized email invitations for peer evaluations
- Personalized evaluation forms per student/team
- Aggregated, structured reporting for professors

## Getting Started (For New Users)

### Prerequisites

1. **Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)**
  - Download and install the LTS version for your operating system.
  - npm is included with Node.js.

2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)** (optional, for cloning the repo)
  - Or download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it.

3. **Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** (already installed)

---

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
  - Using Git: `git clone <repo-url>`
  - Or download ZIP and extract.

2. **Open the Project Folder in VS Code**

3. **Install Dependencies**
  - Open a terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`)
  - Run:
    ```bash
    npm run setup
    ```
  - This will install all required packages for both frontend and backend.

4. **Start the Application**
  - To start both frontend and backend together:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  - Or use the provided scripts:
    - Windows Batch: `./start.bat`
    - PowerShell: `./start.ps1`

5. **Access the App in Your Browser**
  - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  - Backend API: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

### Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about missing dependencies, re-run `npm run setup`.
- If ports 3000 or 5000 are in use, close other apps or change the port in the config.
- For Windows, you may need to allow scripts to run (see PowerShell execution policy).
- If you have issues with email sending, check your `.env` file for SMTP settings.

---

### Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start both frontend and backend servers simultaneously
- `npm run setup` - Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
- `npm run start:backend` - Start only the backend server
- `npm run start:frontend` - Start only the frontend server (default React scripts)
