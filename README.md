# Peer Evaluation Automation and Feedback System

Date: 09/04/2025  
Status: Planning / In Progress

A web-based platform to streamline peer evaluations in team-based courses. Professors can securely create and manage student rosters, assign students to courses/teams, trigger email invitations, and receive structured, professor-friendly reports with both numeric and textual feedback. Optional AI features may summarize comments and flag potential concerns, depending on timeline and scope.

Project website URL: TBD â€” see the team guide for instructions.

## Objectives

- Simplify and automate peer evaluations for team-based courses
- Provide an intuitive UI for professors and students
- Ensure secure roster management and personalized evaluation links
- Generate clear, actionable reports (numeric + textual)
- Optionally use AI to summarize feedback and detect red flags (time-permitting)

---

## Core Features

- Secure professor login and multi-course management
- Student roster upload and team assignment
- Personalized email invitations for peer evaluations
- Personalized evaluation forms per student/team
- Aggregated, structured reporting for professors
- Downloadable reports (raw data, calculated scores, summaries)
- Optional AI assistance:
  - Text summarization of comments
  - Red flag detection (e.g., significant discrepancies or concerning language)

AI features are optional and will depend on remaining timeline after core milestones are met.

## Tech Stack

To be finalized by Milestone 1 (09/28/2025).  
Documentation will specify:
- Front-end framework (TBD)
- Back-end framework (TBD)
- Database (TBD)
- Email service provider / SMTP (TBD)
- Authentication (TBD)
- Optional AI/NLP services or libraries (TBD)

## High-Level Workflow

1. Professor creates course and uploads roster (with emails) and team assignments.  
2. System generates personalized evaluation links.  
3. Email service sends invitations/reminders to students.  
4. Students evaluate teammates via web forms.  
5. System aggregates responses and computes scores.  
6. Professor downloads or views reports (numeric + textual).  
7. Optional: AI summaries and flagged red flags for review.

---

## Security & Privacy

- Store student data securely; restrict access to authorized users only.  
- Use HTTPS for all traffic; protect credentials and tokens.  
- Avoid sending sensitive data in plain text emails.  
- Comply with institutional policies and applicable regulations (e.g., FERPA).  
- Document data retention and deletion policies.

---

## Risks, Assumptions, and Planning

- No major delays currently foreseen.  
- Capacity planned with two front-end and two back-end developers to cover downtime.  
- Client (professor) availability expected to be consistent.  
- AI features are optional and contingent on time after core functionality is complete.  
- Email deliverability and spam filtering may require configuration and testing.

---

## Contributing

- Use feature branches and open pull requests for review.  
- Link issues to PRs and keep commit messages descriptive.  
- Follow coding standards defined in CONTRIBUTING.md (to be added).  
- Document changes in PR descriptions and update relevant docs.
